These tools rely on Kernel-Level Graphics Driver Exhaustion and OOM (Out of Memory) techniques.DO NOT run this on critical infrastructure or medical devices.DO NOT use this to target systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.DDW-X assumes NO LIABILITY for hardware damage (thermal throttling/overheating) or data loss caused by system freezes.This software is provided "AS IS" for educational cybersecurity research and browser vulnerability assessment.🏴‍☠️ IntroductionTitan-WebGPU-Stress is not just a benchmark; it is a weaponized auditing suite designed to expose the fragility of modern browser sandboxing. While browsers like Chrome and Edge attempt to isolate tabs, the interface between the browser and the GPU driver remains a critical attack surface.This tool leverages WebGPU Compute Shaders, Raymarching Volumetrics, and Parallel CPU Worker Threads to bypass standard garbage collection and watchdog timers, forcing the host operating system into a state of non-recoverable resource starvation (DoS).Key Capabilities:Zero-Click Execution: Payloads execute immediately upon DOM load.Hybrid Exhaustion: Simultaneously attacks CPU (Logic Units) and GPU (VRAM/Compute).Watchdog Evasion: Uses mathematically valid but computationally "infinite" loops to trick TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery) mechanisms.💀 Technical Architecture & Attack VectorsBased on the source code analysis of ULTIMA (WebGPU) and EXTREME (WebGL2), this suite utilizes the following vectors:1. The "Gyroid" FBM Crusher (GPU ALU Saturation)The core visual payload is a Raymarching engine rendering a Gyroid surface distorted by Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM).Vector: Math.sin/cos/tan heavy trigonometric abuse inside the shader.Mechanism: The shader forces the GPU to calculate light transport through volumetric fog with up to 6000 steps per pixel.Impact: Instantly saturates 100% of GPU CUDA/Stream Cores, causing immediate desktop lag and preventing OS compositors (DWM/SurfaceFlinger) from updating the screen.2. The "Thread-Burner" (CPU Core Meltdown)The ULTIMA payload spawns Web Workers equal to navigator.hardwareConcurrency.Vector: Infinite while(true) loops performing floating-point chaos math (Math.sqrt(Math.abs(x))).Mechanism: Unlike main-thread loops, these workers cannot be blocked by UI unresponsiveness. They persist until the browser process is forcibly terminated by the OS kernel.3. VRAM Bandwidth FloodVector: Massive StorageBuffer writes (chaosBuffer) and Super-Sampling (1.5x Device Pixel Ratio).Mechanism: Forces the GPU to allocate textures larger than the physical screen resolution, pushing VRAM usage to the limit and triggering aggressive paging to system RAM.📊 Test Environment Report & Verified TargetsThis suite has been rigorous tested by DDW-X in controlled environments. Below are the confirmed results:Target EnvironmentStatusImpact LevelNotesGoogle Chrome (Desktop)🔴 CRITICALTotal System FreezeMouse cursor lag, audio stuttering, TDR reset triggered after 10s.Microsoft Edge🔴 CRITICALBrowser CrashTab crashes immediately with STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION or Out of Memory.Telegram (Android In-App)💀 FATALDevice RebootConfirmed: Opening the link inside Telegram causes the phone UI to freeze, forcing a hard reboot or OS crash.Google Gemini Pro⚡ EJECTEDAI Session KillCRITICAL FINDING: Pasting the source code into the Gemini Pro coding interface caused the AI's rendering environment to crash, forcing a session reload and error RenderProcessGone.iOS Safari (Webkit)🟠 HIGHTab Reload"A problem occurred with this webpage" loop.🚀 Deployment & UsageMethod 1: The "Click & Die" (Hosted)Simply host index.html on any static file server (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).Send the link to the target device.Upon click, the init() function triggers immediately.Result: Browser hang within 500ms.Method 2: Manual InjectionFor testing against XSS filters or AI environments:Copy the raw content of Code1 (ULTIMA).Paste into the target's HTML renderer or "Code Snippet" view.Observe the rendering process crash.🛡️ Mitigation Strategies (For Browser Vendors)To defend against Titan-WebGPU-Stress, vendors must implement:Strict Shader Timeout: Enforce harder limits on WGSL loop execution time independent of OS TDR.Resource Quotas: Limit total compute operations per frame in non-active tabs.Sanitization: Better parsing of nested FBM loops in the shader compiler to detect "infinite complexity" attacks.<div align="center">⚡ Powered by DDW-XAdvancing Security Through Chaos.[ Telegram Channel ] • [ YouTube ]</div>
